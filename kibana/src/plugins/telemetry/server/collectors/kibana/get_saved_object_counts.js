/**
 * Moved from /x-pack/plugins/monitoring/server/kibana_monitoring/collectors/get_kibana_usage_collector.ts
 *
 * The PR https://github.com/elastic/kibana/pull/62665 proved what the issue https://github.com/elastic/kibana/issues/58249
 * was claiming: the structure and payload for common telemetry bits differs between Monitoring and OSS/X-Pack collections.
 *
 * Unifying this logic from Monitoring that makes sense to have in OSS here and we will import it on the monitoring side to reuse it.
